# This is the repository for GeoQuiz

This project is the result of an Agil course with a fullstack written program.

We have develop a web application where the frontend is applied through HTML, CSS, Typescript (Javascript) within the vue framework. The backend is controlled through node.js express. Data storage and data access takes place through TypeORM and MySQL for communication to the database. We version manage with Git and then use GitHub as host for the repository. The target group is adults who are interested in geography or just want to test their knowledge.
